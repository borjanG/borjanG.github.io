I am part of the Inria research team <a href="https://www.inria.fr/en/megavolt">Megavolt</a>, and jointly with <a href="https://sierra-mlopt.github.io">Sierra</a>, we organize a monthly seminar on broad topics linking analysis, learning, and algorithms.

The seminar takes place one monday a month, from 10:30 to 12:00, in the seminar room of Laboratoire Jacques-Louis Lions.
