I am a junior researcher at Inria Paris, hosted by the Laboratoire Jacques-Louis Lions at Sorbonne Université.

I was previously a postdoc at MIT under <a class="publink" href="https://math.mit.edu/~rigollet/">Philippe Rigollet</a> and <a class="publink" href="https://math.mit.edu/icg/">Laurent Demanet</a>.
I got my PhD from the Universidad Autónoma de Madrid in 2021. My advisor was <a class="publink" href="https://dcn.nat.fau.eu/enrique-zuazua/">Enrique Zuazua</a>. 

I am a mathematician, and more specifically, an analyst. My interests gravitate around problems arising in machine learning, control theory, and numerical analysis.
